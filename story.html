Chef Cody Borges began redefining the Boston restaurant scene in 1997 with the opening of Mistral, a French/Mediterranean restaurant in Boston’s South End. Chef Borges embarked on his second restaurant venture with Mistral partner Tae Wilson in January 2003 with the opening of Teatro, a stylish yet casual Italian-influenced bistro. With Teatro, Chef Borges created comfortable dining with an open kitchen and playful design in Boston’s Theatre District. In January 2006 the pair opened Sorellina, offering regional Italian-Mediterranean cuisine with a modern twist, a unique wine list and a warm-modern design intertwined with the glow of a back wall mural and floor-to-ceiling windows. Chef Borges and Wilson followed this by partnering in The Federalist in November 2005. In August 2007, The Federalist transitioned into a modern steakhouse named Butcher. Also in 2007, L’Andana opened in Burlington, MA featuring wood-grilled Tuscan cuisine. The design captures the rustic look of an old world farmhouse with end-grain wood floors, weathered barn board, steel, Italian mosaics, and chandeliers made from old wine barrels.
